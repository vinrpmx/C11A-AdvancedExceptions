What are 3 good practices related to exception handling?

The three good practices in regards to exception handling are:
1. Declaring specific checked exceptions that the method can throw (i.e. don't throw the general "Exceptions" exception).
2. Throwing relevant exceptions from a method to keep code clean and understandable (i.e. NullPointerException dosen't do anything, but NoSuchFileFoundException is relevant to opening files).
3. Always correctly wrap the exceptions in custom exceptions so that the stack trace is not lost. 
	Ex: "throw new MyServiceException("Some information: " + e.getMessage());" is wrong, and just "'Some Information: ' + e" should be printed instead.
